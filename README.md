# CIS17B-S25-33477-Assignment6
I struggled a lot with this assignment since it’s something so new and abstract compared to everything else just in visual studio code. Last week, I did watch every one of the YouTube tutorials and was able to at least download and run QT Creator, design the UI as instructed, and get it to compile and run in a window. However, I struggled connecting my old Congo program to this UI to get it to function. I understand signals and slots hypothetically, but I was unable to execute it. The video tutorials were also very unclear for me about actually sharing applications made in QT Creator, so I wasn’t able to submit anything from my work but I can share these screenshots of my UI I designed and my application running on my end. I know this doesn’t function according to the assignment instructions, but I figured I’d turn in what I was able to complete.
